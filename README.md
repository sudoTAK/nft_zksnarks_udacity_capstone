# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

This is a Blockchain based project. It covers NFT token and Zero Knowledge proof integration on blockchain.
This project explaines how a conventional paper based property buying/selling can be implemented on Blockchain.
Using Zokrates property ownership is verified without revealing any information about the owner of the property.
After the zkSnarks or zero knowledge proof, the owner can mint the token i.e convert his property to NFT and thus
can sale the minted token on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) crypto market.
